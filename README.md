# pushid

This code is originally written by @jeremyworboys.

I did a simple modification on it to overcome the limitation of sorting feature of [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com).
If you add a timestamp to the key, you are able to get queried result sorted out on key in a descending order when doing [complex query](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/retrieving-data.html#section-complex-queries) like equalTo or limitToLast.

Hope Firebase do something more in reading feature.
