# pushid

This code is originally written by @jeremyworboys.

I did a simple modification on it to overcome the limitation of sorting feature of Firebase.
If you add a timestamp to the key, you are able to get queried result sorted out on key in a descending order when doing complex query using equalTo or limitToLast.

Hope Firebase do something more in reading feature.
